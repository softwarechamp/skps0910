#1 Car Pools
Car pooling refers to the sharing of car journeys by people travelling on the same route. Its advantages are:
Reduction of air pollution by vehicular  emissions.
Helps to save money, fuel, time and cost of road repairs.

# 2 - Promotion of public transports
Public transport is a shared transport service which is available to use for general public as a distinct from modes such as taxis, car pooling or hired buses. Public transport mode includes  city buses, trans or light rail, passenger trains and metro rails. 
It serves as a cheap mode of transport for the general public. These buses are mostly run by state governments or transport cooperation like DTC - Delhi Transport Cooperation etc.
Advantages:
Reduction of air pollution and noise pollution by vehicular pollution
Helps to save money, fuel, energy and parking space.
Reduction of traffic jams and travelling time and aversion of accidents and maintainance cost

# 3 - No smoking zones
Smoking is the inhalation of the smoke of burning tobacco in cased in cigarrette, bidi, pipe and cigars.
In this way, nicotine - the active ingredient in tobacco is inhaled into the lungs where most of it stays whereas the rest passes into the blood stream reaching the brain and dispersing throughout the body in about 30 or less seconds.
Smoking is recognized as the leading preventable cause of the death.  Anyone with smoking habits has an increased chance of lung cervical and other types of cancers, respiratory diseases such as asthma, broncoites and cardio vascular diseases such as heart attack, high BP and strokes.
Smoking does not just harm the smokers but also the people nearby who breathe into the smoke exhaled by others (passive smokers)
The passive smokers or those  who unavoidably  breath in second hand tobacco at public places have an increased chance of many health problems such as lung cancer, asthma, broncoites and sudden infant death syndrome in children.  According to WHO, India is home to 12% of the world's smokers. In approximately, around 9 lakhs people die every year in India due to smoking. 
As a preventive measure, mandatory specifics statutory health warning on cigarette packs are introduced in 1975
Smoking in public places was probhibited nation wide from 2 October under the prohibition  of smoking in public places rules 2008.
Smoking ban  pertain to public places which include auditoriums, cinemas, hospitals etc. and there related facilities. 
A  person      caught in smoking in public places has to pay fine. By creating no  smoking zones in public places an attempt has been made to save not only passive smokers but also to encourage smokers to give up smoking.
Advantages:
Reduction of the possiblity of smoke inhaled by non smokers.
Reduction of air pollution leading to better indoor air quality.
Reduction of health care costs and the youth not being influenced to take on the habit of smoking.
Reduction of accidental fires in places with highly flammable materials.

# 4 - Restriction of fossil fuel
Fossil fuels are the major source of energy. 
Coal provides 28% of   all commercial energy in the world. 
Used to produce electricity, make steel, in numerous industries and domestic use.
Petoleum furnishes about 40% of the commercial energy use in the world, provides most of the energy used for transportation and heats millions of the houses as well.
Natural gas accounts for 20% of the commercial energy use.  It is used to heat homes, cook meals, in industries and its compressed form CNG is used as an alternative to petrol / diesel in automobiles.
Fuels are the cause of envrionmental hazards like air pollution, global warming and acid rain.
Global warming -> CO2 
Acid rain ->  SO2
Hazzard to aquatic life by lessening the oxygen content of water -> / oil spills -> transportation of crude oil by sea
Fossil fuels are non renewable source of energy. At present, rate of consumption it is being depleted faster than it being replenished. 
Coal reserves are likely to last for 200 years more and similarly the world's crude oil reserve would be exhaused in just 50 years. It is essential therefore to reduce dependence on such energy resources and explore and exploit enormous potential of alternative sources of energy like solar, tidal, wind, geo-thermal and bio-mass based energy.  They are not only renewable sources of energy but are envrionmentally clean and safe to use.
# 5 - Saving energy
Due to India's population, we face an energy crisis.  Today the fossil fuel are the main source of energy and used in excess in the urban areas. Whereas, in the rural areas energy is scarce and unreliable.
Fossil fuels are being used at an alarming rate. And if this continues, they would not last for consumption for long time.  Hydro-electric power is a clean fuel but at the source of its production, huge dams are needed to be created that creates huge envrionmental problem. Despite urbanization, 74% of India resides in rural areas where villages depend on traditional fuels.  The following measures can help to save energy:
Using products with energy star labels on products and equipments this reduces energy bill by 30%  and electric lighting charges by 40% while cutting pollution
Use a low flow shower head to reduce water consumption and energy usage to heat the water.
Limiting the usage, maintaining and turning off heating and cooling appliances and lighting fixtures when not in use. Replacing light fixture with energy conserving CFL tubes which help 75% of the energy used with incandescent bulbs.
CFLs help to save money use less energy, reduce light bulb changes and lower green house gas emissions.  
LED lighting is more efficient durable versatile and long lasting.
Using public transport or car pool
Making sure that houses are insulated, interior and exterior walls are painted in light color and shades and blinds are installed to moderate outside heat transfer.

# 6 - Organic Farming
Organic farming is an holistic system of farming which is primarily aimed at cultivating land and raising crops in such a way as to keep the soil alive and  in good health by use of organic waste and substances for increased sustainable production in an eco-friendly, pollution free environment. 
It relies upon crop rotation, crop residue etc and exclude the use of synthetic inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides etc.
Its characteristics / advantages are:
Protecting the long term fertility of soil
Providing crop nutrients
Maintaining nitrogen self sufficiency
Preventing weeds, disease and pests
Providing attentive care and management of live stock
